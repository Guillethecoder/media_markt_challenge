We are interested in seeing your approach to these problems. You have considerable flexibility in how you address them. As a Data Engineer, we value your versatility, so solutions may include Python scripts, SQL queries, plain text explanations, or even diagrams.\n",

If you get stuck, feel free to skip the problem and move on. __We will also accept partially completed challenges.__ We want to understand your thought process and the tools you are familiar with. If you don't know how to code a solution but understand how to solve it conceptually, use plain text to explain your answer.\n",
